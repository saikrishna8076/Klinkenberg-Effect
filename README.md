# Gas Permeability & Klinkenberg Factor Analysis

This project provides a Python-based solution for analyzing gas flow through porous media using Darcy’s law and Klinkenberg correction. It is designed for reservoir core analysis and permeability estimation.

# Key Features

Darcy’s Law Implementation: Applied to calculate gas permeability from experimental core data.

Klinkenberg Effect Analysis: Explored the relationship between apparent permeability and inverse mean pressure to validate gas slippage effects.

Linear Regression Modeling: Used to estimate the Klinkenberg factor and extrapolate results.

Absolute Permeability Estimation: Derived accurate values by extrapolating data to infinite pressure, ensuring consistency with theoretical models.
